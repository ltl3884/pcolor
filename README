pcolor

when I put something into console with method puts(eg.  p "ltl3884"), I can hardly find the information,so try to use pcolor 

Installation

sudo gem install pcolor

Use it

>irb
>require 'rubygems'
>require 'pcolor'
>p "ltl3884",:red

you will see "ltl3884" is red

more colors (green,yellow,blue,purple,sky)
